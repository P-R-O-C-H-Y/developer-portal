## Overview

In recent years, the rapid evolution of IoT and AI technologies has significantly enhanced the sensing capabilities of connected devices. Camera sensors are typically used to capture images, providing devices with visual perception capabilities.

[esp-video](https://github.com/espressif/esp-video-components/tree/master/esp_video) is a camera application development component provided by Espressif, designed to provide developers with a simplified, efficient and cost-effective solution for building vision applications. Developers can use esp-video component to quickly drive various types of camera sensors. The key features of the component are:

## Use cases

The ESP32 chips can be connected to various camera sensors. The following applications have been implemented:

- **Image transmission:** ESP32 series of chips equipped with robust networking (Wi-Fi, BLE, Zigbee, Ethernet), these chips enable long-distance transmission of captured images and videos.

- **Segmented Capture:** Integrated with ESP32’s Mesh network, this feature splits tasks between low-power devices (for detection) and high-power devices (for video capture).

- **AI Applications:** ESP32-S and ESP32-P series of chips support on-device AI via [esp-dl](https://github.com/espressif/esp-dl) and [esp-who](https://github.com/espressif/esp-who), enabling features like face recognition, motion tracking, barcode scanning, and more. They also preprocess data (e.g., human detection) for cloud AI. Current applications include smart pet feeders, remote utility monitoring, automated grading, medical testing, and human presence detection.

- **Multi-Camera Systems:**

  1. **Dual-Focus Setup:** Near-camera (close objects) + far-camera (distant objects).

  2. **Color + Monochrome:** Color imaging for detail, monochrome for enhanced night vision sensitivity.

  3. **360° Coverage:** Directional modules (e.g., conference cameras) capture all participants around a table.

## esp-video and esp32-camera

[esp32-camera](https://github.com/espressif/esp32-camera) is the first-generation camera application development component, which has a driver for image sensors compatible with the ESP32 series of chips. [esp-video](https://github.com/espressif/esp-video-components/tree/master/esp_video) is an enhanced version of esp32-camera. The key differences are as follows:

| Feature                   | [esp-video](https://github.com/espressif/esp-video-components/tree/master/esp_video) | [esp32-camera](https://github.com/espressif/esp32-camera) |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Supported Chips**       | ESP32-S3, ESP32-P/C series                                    | ESP32, ESP32S2/S3                                         |
| **Real-Time Performance** | High frame rates                                             | Standard                                                  |
| **ISP Capability**        | Built-in (ESP32-P Series)                                    | Not supported                                             |
| **Video Encoding**        | H.264/JPEG (high-speed)                                      | Not supported                                             |

## Key design principles

esp-video focuses on the following four core strengths:

- **User-Friendly Design:** The component’s API aligns with the V4L2 (Video for Linux 2) standard, enabling developers to interact with cameras as easily as handling regular files—just call `open()` to get started.
- **High Performance:** Optimized hardware-software integration and image processing algorithms (IPA) ensure fast startup, smooth preview, and responsive capture during photo operations.
- **Consistent Functionality:** Supporting chips like ESP32-S3, ESP32-P series, and ESP32-C series, the component achieves unified device control through a standardized abstraction layer for underlying interfaces. Whether it’s diverse camera sensors or system components like ISPs, codecs, and VCMs, all can be managed via `ioctl()`. As shown, common interfaces (MIPI-CSI, DVP, SPI, USB) share the same `open()` and `ioctl()` workflow for seamless operation.

- **Flexible Expansion:** Developers can customize configurations for existing cameras or add new peripheral drivers and control commands to extend functionality.

## Framework architecture

The entire camera application development framework follows a clear four-layer structure, and the esp-video component is located in the middleware layer. The main contents of each layer are:

- **Driver Layer:** Low-level drivers for peripherals such as MIPI-CSI, DVP, SPI, I2C, I3C, ISP, JPEG, and H.264.
- **Device Layer:** Abstracts hardware variations, reducing integration complexity while ensuring broad compatibility.
- **Middleware Layer:** Routes commands to the correct device, executes them, and returns results to the application. 
- **Application Layer:** Offers a unified API to simplify development.

## Getting started

1. **Find supported camera sensors** at [esp_cam_sensor](https://github.com/espressif/esp-video-components/tree/master/esp_cam_sensor).
2. **Select a supported device** from [the list of supported video devices](https://github.com/espressif/esp-video-components/tree/master/esp_video#video-device) based on the hardware interface being used.
3. **Open the device** using `open()`.
4. **Retrieve image data** with `ioctl(fd, VIDIOC_DQBUF, ...)`.
4. **Release memory** after use via `ioctl(fd, VIDIOC_QBUF, ...)`.

A simple example of capturing image data from a camera sensor is [capture_stream](https://github.com/espressif/esp-video-components/tree/master/esp_video/examples/capture_stream).
